# Disease-Prediction-System

This system aims to predict accurately the disease a person is suffering from based on the symptoms provided by the user. It is website made using the Flask framework in python.

After running main.py in Visual Studio Code you can run the website on the localhost. 

While working with flask create a directory say website and then place the above downloaded files (static, template) in the same directory. 

Also while adding symptoms if you don't wish to add more you can put none.
